You can count number of words in a text file in Python by following a sequence of steps.
To count the number of words in a text file, follow these steps.
Open the file in read mode and handle it in text mode.
Read the text using read() function.
Split the text using space separator. We assume that words in a sentence are separated by a space character.
The length of the split list should equal the number of words in the text file.
You can refine the count by cleaning the string prior to splitting or validating the words after splitting.

Python is very simple.
